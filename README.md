## 设置环境变量 
    set HTTPS=true&&yarn start http变成https访问模式

## create-react-app 搭建react脚手架
### 会安装三个模块 
#### `react`
#### `react-dom`
#### `react-scripts`
* ##### `集成了webpack所需的所有依赖`
* ##### `babel转义 react转义 都会转成es5语法 css处理和自动加样式前缀`
#### react
## react-dom & react
### `react`
#### MVC模式（model view controller）
#### 划分组件开发
#### 基于路由的spa单页面开发
    react框架的核心部分，提供了component类可以提供我们进行组件开发，提供了钩子函数（生命周期函数）
    
### `JSX渲染机智`
    1，基于BABEL中的语法解析模块（babel-preset-react）把JSX语法编译为React.createElement的结构



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
